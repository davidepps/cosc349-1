To use the timezone converter clone the repository into your local directory
make sure you have changed into the correct directory and type 'vagrant up --provider virtualbox'.
The build time will take approximately 6 to 8 minutes.
Once the build is complete, in a web browser type 'http://localhost:8080' or 'http://192.168.2.11/index.php'

To use the converter, you will see a table with the timezones that you are able to convert.
Under the table is a combobox with the same timezones, choose one and click the convert button.
You will have your conversion, to do a new conversion click the back button and select a different 
timezone to convert.
